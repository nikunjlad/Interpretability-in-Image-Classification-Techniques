Once upon a time, during 1500 B.C. in ancient Egypt, the Egyptians were on the verge of a major invention, the invention
of sundials. How do we measure time? Back in the day, the measurement was not like how today's clocks measure time. In fact
for 3 millenia or more the basic unit of time was he period of daylight. The Egyptians broke the period of sunrise to
sunset in 12 parts, giving us the forerunner of today's hours. Unlike the constant length of hours as measured today by
our clocks the Egyptian hour was not of constant length; infact it varied with seasons and also based on the length of the
day. It also varied from place to place on the surface of the Earth. Most importantly, time as a measurable concept
effectively ceased during the time of darkness when there was no sunlight. The Egyptians did not account of the hours the
light was not present.

The need to measure time independently of the sun eventually gave rise to various devices, most notably sandglasses,
waterclocks and candles. The first two of these utilized the flow of some substance to measure time, the latter the
steady fall in the height of the candle. All three provided a metaphor for time as something that flows continuously,
and thus began to shape the way we think of time. Though their accuracy was never great, these devices not only provided
a way to measure time without the need for the sun to be visible in the sky, they also provided the basis for a concept
of time that did not depend upon the length of the day.

As humans we experience a revolution every now and then in our lifetime. In the field of technology, we had our
**First Industrial Revolution** during the 1780-1840 period where we transitioned from hand made goods to automated
machines for increasing production and this lead to big shift in economy and lives. Mechanical machines were used which
could work on potential energy and kinetic energy and which could help reduce human effort by harnessing the natural
powers available. Likewise, we had our **Second Industrial Revolution** during the 1870-1920 period. In this revolution
we saw widespread adoption of new technologies like telegraph and railroad networks for transportation. Gas and Water
supply systems were setup and likewise sewage treatment plants were installed. A majority of mechanical machinery were
transitioned to electrified units where electricity was used. We then had the **Scientific Technological Revolution**
from 1940-1970 period, where nationwide communications, electronic computers and space technology was developed.
This revolution brought about changes like personal computers and which replaced bulky mainframe systems. We finally
have the **Third Industrial Revolution** also called as **Digital Revolution** from 1975-2020 which marked the birth of
the internet, personal handheld devices, navigation systems and more sophisticated surveillance networks. This
revolution is the one which saw the maximum amount of growth both economically and technologically for the entire world.
We came across the term artificial intelligence and how it can change the way we operate in our lives. We are slowly
transitioning from the **Digital Revolution** to the **A.I. Revolution** which will completely transform human experiences.


What is Computer Vision?
------------------------

I don't know if you have come across this word - "Computer Vision" earlier, but, I am pretty sure you must have
heard Machine Learning and other buzz words. What exactly is Computer Vision? If I were to explain a 5-year old or a
general population in particular what this is, then I would say -

> **it's the science of making intelligent systems using images and videos**.

Yes, it is a science since there are a lot of algorithms involved and the field is expanding at an
exponential rate. And since we primarily focus on Images and Videos and depth maps, it's called vision, pertaining to
the human visual sensory system. So, now you have a fair idea about what computer vision is. But, is that all about this
field? That doesn't rather cover the entire spectrum of applications! Next up, I would like to go about some important and
specific areas of Computer Vision along with their applications and examples.

Image Classification
-----------------------

Image Classification is one of the most popular application of computer vision. The idea is quite simple and there are
many techniques to help us achieve it. While I won't be covering the various techniques which help us achieve Image
Classification, I will be giving you the higher level overview of the concept. As the name suggests, given an image we
want to classify in which category does it belong to or in more subtle terms, describe a picture in one or two words.
The algorithm which help us achieve Image Classification are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This algorithm when
tweaked and modified can lead to various architectures with different performance scores. Over the period of 6-7 years,
a lot of research is done in this domain. Some popular architectures using CNNs as their core component include -
**Residual Networks (ResNets)**, **GoogleNet**, **VGG-16**, etc.

Everyone wants to do Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep Learning. I know,
saying out loud like - "I am a Deep Learning Engineer", itself gives the best of us goosebumps. While, I too was in the
same situation until a few years ago, I won't complain about people being in the same boat now. However, Machine Learning is
not Computer Vision. A lot of people confuse these terms. AI, ML, DL, etc. are commonly used acronyms. Its however
important to know the difference between them. Artificial intelligence is a big domain and a field comprising of many
sub-fields. In fact more than a field, it is an idea to be more subtle. Anything which can help mimic human brain in
terms of behaviour and intelligence is an artificially intelligent system. Intelligence which is artificial in nature and analogous to
humans. Machine Learning is a sub domain of Artificial Intelligence which is basically using a set of algorithms to
solve complex real world problems. Statistical Learning is a subset of Machine learning which deals with statistical
analysis and uses traditional algorithms for its computations. These algorithms include Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive-Bayes, etc.
