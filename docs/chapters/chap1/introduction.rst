As humans we experience a revolution every now and then in our lifetime. In the field of technology, we had our
**First Industrial Revolution** during the 1780-1840 period where we transitioned from hand made goods to automated
machines for increasing production and this lead to big shift in economy and lives. Mechanical machines were used which
could work on potential energy and kinetic energy and which could help reduce human effort by harnessing the natural
powers available. Likewise, we had our **Second Industrial Revolution** during the 1870-1920 period. In this revolution
we saw widespread adoption of new technologies like telegraph and railroad networks for transportation. Gas and Water
supply systems were setup and likewise sewage treatment plants were installed. A majority of mechanical machinery were
transitioned to electrified units where electricity was used. We then had the **Scientific Technological Revolution**
from 1940-1970 period, where nationwide communications, electronic computers and space technology was developed.
This revolution brought about changes like personal computers and which replaced bulky mainframe systems. We finally
have the **Third Industrial Revolution** also called as **Digital Revolution** from 1975-2020 which marked the birth of
the internet, personal handheld devices, navigation systems and more sophisticated surveillance networks. This
revolution is the one which saw the maximum amount of growth both economically and technologically for the entire world.
We came across the term artificial intelligence and how it can change the way we operate in our lives. We are slowly
transitioning from the **Digital Revolution** to the **A.I. Revolution** which will completely transform human experiences.


What is Computer Vision?
------------------------

I don't know if you have come across this word - "Computer Vision" earlier, but, I am pretty sure you must have
heard Machine Learning and other buzz words. Everyone wants to do Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep Learning. I know,
saying out loud like - "I am a Deep Learning Engineer", itself gives the best of us goosebumps. While, I too was in the
same situation until a few years ago, I won't complain about people being in the same boat. However, Machine Learning is
not Computer Vision. A lot of people confuse these terms. AI, ML, DL, etc. are commonly used acronyms. Its however
important to know the difference between them. Artificial intelligence is a big domain and a field comprising of many
sub-fields. In fact more than a field, it is an idea to be more subtle. Anything which can help mimic human brain in
terms of behaviour is an artificially intelligent system. Intelligence which is artificial in nature and analogous to
humans. Machine Learning is a sub domain of Artificial Intelligence which is basically using a set of algorithms to
solve complex real world problems. Statistical Learning is a subset of Machine learning which deals with statistical
analysis and using traditional algorithms for
