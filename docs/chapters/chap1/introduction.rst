As humans we experience a revolution every now and then in our lifetime. In the field of technology, we had our
**First Industrial Revolution** during the 1780-1840 period where we transitioned from hand made goods to automated
machines for increasing production and this lead to big shift in economy and lives. Mechanical machines were used which
could work on potential energy and kinetic energy and which could help reduce human effort but harnessing the natural
powers available. Likewise, we had our **Second Industrial Revolution** during the 1870-1920 period. In this revolution
we saw widespread adoption of new technologies like telegraph and railroad networks for transportation. Gas and Water
supply systems were setup and likewise sewage treatment plants were installed. A majority of mechanical machinery were
transitioned to electrified units where electricity was used. We then had the **Scientific Technological Revolution**
from 1940-1970 period, where nationwide communications, electronic computers and space technology was developed.
This revolution brought about changes like personal computers and which replaced bulky mainframe systems. We finally
have the **Third Industrial Revolution** also called as **Digital Revolution** from 1975-2020 which marked the birth of
the internet, personal handheld devices, navigation systems and more sophisticated surveillance networks. This
revolution is the one which saw the maximum amount of growth both economically and technologically for the entire world.
We came across the term artificial intelligence and how it can change the way we operate in our lives. We are slowly
transitioning from the **Digital Revolution** to the **A.I. Revolution** which will completely transform human experiences.


What is Computer Vision?
------------------------

I don't know if you must have come across this word - "Computer Vision" earlier, but, I am pretty sure you must have
heard Machine Learning and other buzz words.
