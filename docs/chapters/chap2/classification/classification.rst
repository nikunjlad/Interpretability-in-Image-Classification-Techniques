Image Classification is one of the most popular application of computer vision. The idea is quite simple and there are
many techniques to help us achieve it. While I won't be covering the various techniques which help us achieve Image
Classification, I will be giving you the higher level overview of the concept. As the name suggests, given an image we
want to classify in which category does it belong to or in more subtle terms, describe a picture in one or two words.
The algorithm which help us achieve Image Classification are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This algorithm when
tweaked and modified can lead to various architectures with different performance scores. Over the period of 6-7 years,
a lot of research is done in this domain. Some popular architectures using CNNs as their core component include -
**Residual Networks (ResNets)**, **GoogleNet**, **VGG-16**, etc.
